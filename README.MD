# Deforestation Watch with BFAST in CUDA 

## What is this Repository?

This repository contains an exam project of the Master's course *Programming Massively Parallel Hardware* at the Department for Computer Science, University of Copenhagen.
We developed an optimised `CUDA` implementation of the algorithm BFAST interpreting deforestation levels from satellite images of Peru and Sahara. The project was based on a scientific paper *Massively-Parallel Change Detection for Satellite Time Series Data with Missing Values*. 

The full implementation, including data and instructions for use, is located in `src`, the additional folder is of no use at all.

This project was created by Rune Taj Clemens Petersen and Sarah Maria Hyatt.
